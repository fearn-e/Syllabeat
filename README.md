# Syllabeat

Syllabeat is a rhythm game focused on following along with the vocalist of the song. Keys will flash up on the displayed keyboard representation, and you must tap the corresponding key on your keyboard when the growing white box and the purple box overlap exactly. The closer your timing, the more points you score, and hitting lots of notes in a row successfully will increase your combo multiplier. Most of the time, and more so on higher difficulties, these keys will tend to fall on every syllable.

There are currently 4 charts of 2 songs, 2 difficulties for each, as well as a simple ABC track which can be used to test your latency. At the end of each track, on top of all the other statistics, you are told how much on average you were off of each note. If that number is more than 10ms in either direction, it might be worthwhile adjusting your input latency in the options window.

The only other non self-explainable option there is "track speed". This adjusts how slow the notes move â€“ you will still have the same timing window and have to hit the notes just as often, but increasing this value will allow you a bigger window to react to new notes. The trade-off with this is that it makes sight-reading and precise timing harder, and so advanced players may choose to lower this value.

Navigating the menus is straightforward; W/S or arrow keys will allow you to scroll the track list, and enter/space will start the selected track. If you'd like, you can quit out mid-song by tapping the escape key.
